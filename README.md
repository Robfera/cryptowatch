## CryptoWatch
**CryptoWatch is a tool for analysing cryptocoins's prices.**  
  
This is a personal project and my first website. I'm doing it mainly for learning.

## To-do list

- [x] Display data for each coin separately
- [x] Implement a search engine
- [x] Optimize the API calls
- [x] Update data in real-time
- [x] Display data in different currencies
- [x] Display more useful data and statistics
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Implement a CMS
- [ ] Implement an API that predicts the coins's trends (Very hard for me to do but I believe I could make it work)

## Details and APIs
I'm developing all in local with Node.  
**DEFAULT PORT: _8080._** It can be changed in "**app.js**", variable "**const port**"  
**DEFAULT IP: _127.0.0.1:8080._** It can be changed in "**homepageApp.js**", variable "**const website**".  
I'll make a CMS when the website will be stable, so it will be easier to configure the app.
  
I'm using [CoinMarketCap's API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) for the data
and the [Cryptocoins iconpack](https://github.com/AllienWorks/cryptocoins) for the icons.
